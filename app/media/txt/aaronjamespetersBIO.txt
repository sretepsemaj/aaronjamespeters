Aaron James Peters – Personal Biography

Aaron James Peters was born on November 26, 1979, in Wiesbaden, Germany as an American abroad. He began his education at a German grade school where he learned German fluently. He then later transferred to the Munich International School when his parents moved from the Frankfurt area to Munich. After his parents separated, Aaron relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he attended 10th grade. He later returned to Frankfurt to live with his father and completed his high school education at the Franfurt International School.

After high school, Aaron took a year off to explore his interests and discovered his passion for gardening. He enrolled at Cuyamaca College, known for its outstanding horticulture program, where his sister Erika was attending its sister school, Grossmont College. During this time, Aaron honed his skills in plant care and nursery management. His dedication led him to become a manager at a nursery, running the plant operations. Later, he seized the opportunity to step into sales management, building new client accounts at a local farm. With these experiences, Aaron expanded his expertise by managing a hydroponics store, helping home gardeners succeed while ensuring meticulous inventory management. He maintained an impressive 99% inventory accuracy and consistently prepared detailed reports for tax purposes.

Despite his success in horticulture and retail management, Aaron felt the need for a career change. A chance meeting with Steve Parsons introduced him to plumbing, a trade that offered stability and hands-on problem-solving. Aaron thrived in the field, eventually starting his own business, where his sales acumen and entrepreneurial spirit made the venture both exciting and rewarding. However, over time, the physical demands of the profession and a growing sense of unfulfillment prompted him to reevaluate his path.

In the midst of a personal and professional crossroads, Aaron’s sister introduced him to the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI). Initially intrigued by how AI helped her write more effective emails, Aaron quickly became captivated by the technology. His first experience writing code left him mesmerized, sparking a newfound passion for learning. He dove headfirst into the world of AI, building a simple Flask snake game as one of his early projects. With every project, his coding skills grew, and he realized the boundless potential of this game-changing technology.

Eager to deepen his understanding, Aaron enrolled in college to study AI and data management. What began as a personal journey of reinvention has since become a mission to contribute meaningfully to the AI revolution. He hopes to find a position where he can continue to apply his growing expertise, using technology not only to improve his own life but also to help others. Aaron sees AI as a powerful tool for building a brighter, more connected future for all of humanity.
