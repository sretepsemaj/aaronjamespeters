GitHub Projects Overview

aaronjamespeters (https://github.com/sretepsemaj/aaronjamespeters.git)

-Building this Flask app for my profile page and application process was a valuable learning experience that significantly expanded my knowledge for future projects. I started with the basics and ended up creating a modern, responsive web app using Flask and Bootstrap. Along the way, I figured out how to load bio and resume content from text files, making updates easy without touching the code. I learned to use Bootstrap buttons and FontAwesome for navigation and added AOS for smooth scroll animations. Each section—Bio, Resume, Projects, and YouTube—taught me something new, from styling pages to organizing the code with Blueprints to keep it modular and scalable using best practices. I ran into plenty of challenges, especially with formatting and getting the YouTube page working, but every fix became an opportunity to learn and improve. By the end, I had a fully functional app that’s clean, responsive, and ready for both desktop and mobile.

og1-0 (https://github.com/sretepsemaj/og1-0.git)

-This project was created as a return to the basics in a simple pythong Flask project to truly understand the relationship between .env files for development, production, and staging, and how they interact with base.py, dev.py, and prod.py configuration files. Gaining this understanding was crucial for mastering deployment and server configuration. While building projects locally is great, learning about deployment, logging management, and effective AI coaching for code generation made a significant difference. This taught me how to troubleshoot and debug more efficiently while coaching (cassi) the AI to generate code exactly where it's needed. The project is deployed on Render and can be viewed at https://og1-0.onrender.com. This experience gave me a solid foundation in deployment, log/debugging and configuration—valuable skills I plan to apply to rebuild all my prior projects.

BuildingCodeAI (https://github.com/sretepsemaj/BuildingCodeAI.git)

-This was one of my latest projects, built using Windurf Code Editor with setup guidance from OpenAI. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into Django admin, user logins, and a much deeper understanding of folder structures and media management. It also introduced me to SQLite instances and document path linkage. While the project definitely needs to be rebuilt, it was a significant step in my learning journey.

NEWSai (https://github.com/sretepsemaj/NEWSai.git)

-This project also needs a complete rebuild now that I'm more proficient in Django. NEWSai was an exciting project that helped me truly grasp Git's purpose and version control. Built in VS Code with OpenAI-assisted code generation, it was my first real dive into how Git enables efficient project management and collaboration. I'm excited to revisit this project and rebuild it from the ground up using everything I've learned since then.

PlumbingINC

-Unfortunately, this project no longer exists on GitHub or AWS due to an unexpected deletion. Although the loss was frustrating—especially after dealing with AWS's high fees—I walked away with a limited but important understanding of EC2, VPC configuration, and how to manage AWS resources effectively. It was a valuable experience in cloud services, even if things didn't go exactly as planned. I definitly taught me a lot.
