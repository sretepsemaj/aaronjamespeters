                        <p>Building this Flask app for my profile page and application process brought together everything I’ve learned from past projects, and I managed to create it in record time. I’m confident the next one will be even easier, with less back-and-forth coaching from Cassi (Codeium AI). If you don’t know how to ask the right questions, though, you can easily end up in an endless loop and hit that classic brain-stack overflow! My goal was to build a simple, modern, responsive web app using Flask and Bootstrap while deepening my understanding of configuration and log management across different environments. What better way to do that than by using my resume as the project?</p>
                        
                        <p>Along the way, I learned how to load bio and resume content from text files, making updates easy without touching the code. I got more comfortable with using Bootstrap buttons and FontAwesome for navigation and added AOS for smooth scroll animations to enhance the user experience. Each section—Bio, Resume, Projects, and YouTube—taught me something new, from styling pages to organizing code with Blueprints to keep everything modular and scalable using best practices. I hit plenty of challenges, especially with formatting and getting the YouTube page to work properly (w/ thumbnails no less!), but every fix became an opportunity to learn and improve. Honestly, I enjoy the process of troubleshooting—there’s nothing like the reward of seeing everything work after some solid problem-solving.</p>
                        
                        <p>By the end, I had a fully functional app that’s clean, responsive, and ready for both desktop and mobile. There are still a few tweaks I want to make before redeploying, but the server is running the code successfully—and that feels pretty great!</p>

                        <p>This project was created as a return to the basics—a simple Python Flask project to truly understand the relationship between .env files for development, production, and staging, and how they interact with base.py, dev.py, and prod.py configuration files. My goal was to focus on core concepts and improve my understanding of environment management and configuration. I built the project with a standard Flask application structure, starting with a basic routing system. The templates and static files were straightforward, and I used WTForms for handling basic forms, which helped me grasp the interaction between routes, templates, and forms in a clean and organized way. I learned how to manage environment variables using .env files for different environments, allowing me to switch easily between development, production, and staging without disrupting the ap</p>
                        
                        <p>One of the key lessons was setting up a robust logging system. I implemented rotating file handlers, introduced a trace ID for easier log tracking, and configured different log levels—debug, info, and error—to monitor the app's performance across environments. For the database, I configured SQLAlchemy and set up a basic model structure. The project supported PostgreSQL, giving me hands-on experience with database connections and integrating them into a Flask project. Deployment was another important learning opportunity. I configured the app for deployment on Render.com, creating a Procfile and managing dependencies through a requirements.txt file, which made the process much simpler and gave me a solid understanding of how to get a Flask app running in the cloud.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I set up a basic test structure using pytest, organizing the test directory and writing simple tests to ensure the core functionality of the app worked as expected. It reinforced the importance of testing, even in smaller projects. By returning to the fundamentals, I gained a deeper understanding of how all these pieces fit together—knowledge that will help me build more scalable, secure, and maintainable projects in the future.</p>

                        <p>Although I need to rebuild this project, I gained valuable experience and insights along the way. I’ll be applying everything I’ve learned and rebuilding it soon.</p>

                        <p>Building BuildingCodeAI has been an incredible learning experience, teaching me how to structure a Django app while improving my overall development workflow. I learned how to manage environments with .env files for development and production, even experimenting with staging. Setting up a scalable project structure helped me implement user and admin authentication while exploring semantic search with embeddings for large datasets—though the embedding files were too large to upload to Git. Debugging and logging became essential skills, particularly configuring separate info.log and error.log files for monitoring across environments. I also worked on media file management and integrated various AI APIs. The frontend gave me a chance to implement responsive design using Bootstrap and Jinja2 templates, with smooth animations from AOS for a polished user experience. Through trial and error, I improved at using Git, managing branches, and organizing dependencies in requirements.txt. Each step pushed me to think more about scalability, security, and best practices—knowledge I'll carry into future projects.</p>

                        <p>The app follows a well-organized Django project structure with proper configuration management and is built with Python 3.12+ and Django 5.0.2. Environment management is handled through .env and .env.example files for different environments. The development infrastructure includes version control with Git and code quality tools such as Flake8 for linting, MyPy for type checking, and Black for code formatting. I also set up pre-commit hooks and used Pytest for testing.</p>
                            
                        <p>Key features of the app include a user authentication system, comprehensive building code management functionality, and extensive models (models.py at 14.8 KB) and views (views.py at 14.2 KB). Custom template tags, form handling, and static file management enhance flexibility and functionality. The testing infrastructure includes API system tests, dedicated test directories, and detailed documentation in the docs directory. The project also features a well-documented README with setup instructions.</p>

                        <p>For the database, I used SQLite (db.sqlite3), with migrations in place to keep everything up to date. The frontend is template-based, with organized static files, custom forms, and responsive design. Utility functions are grouped in a dedicated utils directory, and I created custom management commands for greater control. The environment switching script (switch_env.sh) and activation script (activate.sh) made it easy to switch between environments.</p>

                        <p>Security was a key focus, with proper media file handling, secure access control, and environment variable management for sensitive data. The project adheres to high standards, with a clear Code of Conduct, licensing information, and development setup scripts, along with thorough documentation to ensure maintainability and scalability.</p>

                        <h2>NEWSai</h2>
                        <p>This is my favorite project so far and, hopefully, a glimpse into the future—an app that could truly change the world. Using AI to generate unbiased, non-partial news, combining stories from multiple perspectives into one well-written, objective article, could help raise awareness and bring people closer to the truth. I’ve learned so much through this experience. I definitly will rebuild this one.</p>
                        
                        <p>This Django project was an incredible opportunity to sharpen my web development skills while integrating advanced features like AI and external APIs. Built using Django’s MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture, the project gave me hands-on experience with URL routing, views, and templates. I focused on integrating AI models for news analysis, particularly using OpenAI, GroqAI, NEWSapi, Hugging Face, Perplexity AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and summarize objective news stories. One of the core challenges was building a news processing pipeline that fetches stories from multiple sources, processes and summarizes the content, and presents balanced reporting from different perspectives. The project also included API integration with authentication via bearer tokens, along with error handling to ensure robust API interactions.</p>

                        <p>Modern web development practices were essential to this build. I implemented AJAX for asynchronous data loading, CSRF protection for security, and session management for storing user data. Cache control helped optimize performance, while Django’s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) simplified database management and model creation. The Article model served as the foundation for handling news content, while transaction management ensured data integrity across operations. The project followed Django’s best practices for organization, with separate apps like broadcast and paperboy to keep functionality modular. Static and media file management were key components, ensuring proper template rendering and organized file storage.</p>

                        <p>Security was a top priority throughout the project. I used environment variables for secure API key handling and implemented comprehensive error handling and logging to track issues. The logging system provided user-friendly error messages, which made troubleshooting easier. Managing different environments was another significant aspect, with virtual environments (venv) and environment-specific configuration using .env files to ensure smooth development and deployment.</p>

                        <p>Each step of the project reinforced the importance of clean code and modular structure. Separating concerns across different apps and documenting functions helped keep the code maintainable and scalable. This project pushed me to apply everything I’ve learned—balancing functionality, security, and performance in a professional Django web application. I’m excited to continue improving it and believe it has real potential to make a difference.</p>

                        <h2>PlumbingINC</h2>
                        <p>This wasn’t my first project, and I really regret not having it anymore. I learned so much from it—working with templates, CSS, JavaScript, and setting up page endpoints. It was also the first project I successfully deployed. Unfortunately, the "free" AWS tier didn’t stay free for long. At the time, I didn’t know about Git, so when I cleaned up my computer, I think I accidentally deleted the folder along with about a thousand other random PlumbinINC directories named PlumbingINC1.0, 1.1, 1.2, as I thought I was managing different versions that way.</p>

                        <p>The project eventually disappeared from AWS due to unexpected charges I couldn’t justify. Although the loss was frustrating—especially after dealing with AWS's high fees—I walked away with a limited but valuable understanding of EC2, VPC configuration, and how to manage AWS resources more effectively for deployment.</p>
